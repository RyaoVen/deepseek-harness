/**
 * Construction of the pi-ai `Provider` that one configured route registers into
 * the adapter's `Models` collection.
 *
 * Two constructions, one decision: a route the installed catalog ships, whose
 * profile does not override the wire protocol, **reuses that catalog provider**
 * with its models replaced — the catalog provider owns API implementations this
 * package cannot reconstruct (Bedrock loads its Smithy module through a
 * separate entry point), so rebuilding it from parts would silently narrow
 * which providers work. Every other single-protocol route — one pi-ai has
 * never heard of, or a catalog route pointed at a different protocol — is
 * built by `createProvider` over the protocol table below. A route with
 * per-model protocol repoints mixes protocols and dispatches each request on
 * the model's own `api` instead.
 *
 * Credentials never reach this module's storage: the harness resolves a route's
 * key through `ctx.credentials` before the request enters pi-ai and hands it
 * over as a stream option, which `Models` presents to `resolve()` as the
 * credential key.
